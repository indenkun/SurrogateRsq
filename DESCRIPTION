Description: To assess and compare the models' goodness of fit, R-squared is one of the most 
              popular measures. For categorical data analysis, however, no universally adopted 
              R-squared measure can resemble the ordinary least square (OLS) R-squared for 
              linear models with continuous data. This package implement the surrogate R-squared
              measure for categorical data analysis, which is proposed in the study of Dungang Liu,
              Xiaorui Zhu, Brandon Greenwell, and Zewei Lin (2022) <doi:10.1111/bmsp.12289>. It
              can generate a point or interval measure of the surrogate R-squared. It can also 
              provide a ranking measure of the percentage contribution of each variable to the 
              overall surrogate R-squared. This ranking assessment allows one to check the 
              importance of each variable in terms of their explained variance. This package can
              be jointly used with other existing R packages for variable selection and model 
              diagnostics in the model-building process.
